 * Class used as a wrapper over the DropBox API's unchecked exceptions when

 * <p>The problem mainly comes from {@link DbxClient.Uploader} and {@link
 * DbxClient.Uploader}. Both of these methods define a {@code close()} method
 * but none of them implement {@link Closeable}. Worse than that, at least as
 * far as the uploader is concerned, this method is not even idempotent, and all
 * exceptions it throws are <strong>unchecked</strong>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The file system API, however, needs "correct" {@link IOException}s to be
 * thrown. We therefore capture all {@link RuntimeException}s thrown by either a
 * downloader or an uploader, and wrap it into such an exception.</p>
